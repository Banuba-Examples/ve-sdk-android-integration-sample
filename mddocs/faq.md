### 1. I want to start and stop video recording by short click.  
The user has to keep pressing recording button to record new video by default. Video recording stops when the user releases finger from recording button.  

Please set [takePhotoOnTap](https://github.com/Banuba/ve-sdk-android-integration-sample/blob/main/app/src/main/assets/camera.json#4) property to **false** to allow the user to start and stop recording new video by short click.
